Contributing
Please submit bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests to the GitHub issue tracker.
We're particularly interested in fixing edge-cases, expanding test coverage, and updating translations.
If you find a mistake in the docs, or want to add something, go ahead and amend the wiki - anyone can edit it.
If you have git clones from prior to the move to the PHPMailer GitHub organization, youâ€™ll need to update any remote URLs referencing the old GitHub location with a command like this from within your clone:
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.git
